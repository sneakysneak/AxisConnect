# AxisConnect
This is an app developed for a project to display current gyro data 
in order to change led colours on a ledboard. 
It connects with MQTT which provides continuous stream.
So with iPhone you can send data through MQTT to a raspberry
pi, which can control anything; to change colours, the order
of the leds etc.

CocoaMQTT must be installed in xcode.
